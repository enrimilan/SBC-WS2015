This project has been developed as a solution of the assignments during the course
"Distributed Programming with Space Based Computing Middleware".
@Authors: Enri Miho & Arber Kryeziu


The solution comprises of two parts:
    1. RMI as Non-Spaced-Technology
    2. MozartSpaces 2.3 as Space-Based-Technology

Maven was used as a build tool, hence to build and run the project installation of Maven and a Java version of 1.8 is required on your computer.
To compile, package and install all the artifacts used in this project, the command "mvn install" must be invoked in the root directory (e.g. where pom.xml file is)

Otherwise, to start the application (which also includes compiling the whole project), there are scripts available in "bin" directory.
For both parts of the solution, the scripts are placed in sub-directories rmi and xvms , respectively.

To start the GUI and server (inc. building of the project):
    RMI: /rmi/gui.bat
    XVSM: /xvsm/gui.bat

Start [function]-robots (where [function] = {supplier|assembler|calibrator|tester|painter}:
    RMI: /rmi/[function].bat (follow instruction in console)
    XVSM: /xvsm/[function].bat (follow instruction in console)


The robots can also be started from the GUI. To take use of that, the project name should not contain any white-spaces in it.
